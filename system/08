# What file contains the RSA keys of systems that are authorized to connect via SSH?
# RSA algorithm is asymmetric cryptography algorithm that works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key.
# first, generate SSH keys using cmd ssh-keygen
# then, using cmd ssh-copy-id username@remote_host eg. user@debian
# then, the authorized key file is created in the home directory.
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
